# Caesar_Cipher
This repository contains full python program which is helpful to understand the visualization of Caesar Cipher used for encryption and decryption of the messages by the shift technique.



The First Line of the Program contains the variable of type list which has All the alphabets included in it.



These Alphabets are all in Lower Case 




If you require to make a program of both LowerCase and Uppercase it is possible too by making two different variables of type list




Main Points to be taken care of:


          1. The else part of the for loop at line no.12 is helpful when user write a symbol or number instead of alphabet.
          2. should_continue will allow the user to run this program as per their requirement
          3. Shift variable at line no 24 will help when user enters higher value of shift_amount and prevent from making errors
